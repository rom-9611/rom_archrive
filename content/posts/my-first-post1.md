Rooting a phone is kinda reduntant nowadays as most users that want some customization can enjoy apps like nova launcher, klck, kwgt etc and are happy with the power and control they are given.
But As someone who enjoys Linux, everything seemed locked down and rooting my device seemed like the next logical step as it will give me power with no restriction 
 
Also after my years of fustration with stock one ui where if i want to do something like access ~/android/data and copy, i have to go through a myriad of bullshit to do it due to fucking "security reasons"

Reasons of rooting my phone :
1. I have a laptop with linux on it , and with a rooted phone into the mix. This leads to a start for an ecosystem built on various possibilities to expand by me
2. System-wide adblock that keeps the device fast and doesn't effect data speed while consuming little to no battary life
3. Modding apps through various framework to do things unheard of like unlimited cloud storage (this made me question the legality of what i am doing)
4. Addition of powerfull privacy focused tools that alter things down to the boot level 
5. Full controll over the phone's hardware enabling one to capture dlsr similiar quality images, google image processing, deep integration of either self-made ai or ai made by others and many more


Though dispite my high praises i didn't have the smoothest experience due to the very steep learning curve
Unlocking the bootloader of galaxy a51 was very simple.
After that, learning to find my exact firmware and flashing it for rescue and extracting it for boot.img and vbmeta was a real struggle 
Though my persistence to not watch tutorial didn't help my case leading to a no. of failed attempts and random things breaking (sometimes flashing the stock firmware and redoing the entire process)

So, Was it worth it?
To me definitely despite my struggles but i won't recommend doing rooting to normal users

Advice for beginners:
1. Do it on a secondary phone (not like me)
2. Read xda threads and try to find the latest info 
3. Accept breaking things as learning
4. Back up everything
5. Don't rush like me it is impossible to root in a single day if it is your first time
